# charger_autocutoff
This project is about designing and creating an advanced battery charger with an auto cut-off
feature. The goal is to make a charger that works efficiently with modern battery-powered
devices while being safe and easy to use. The auto cut-off feature will stop charging when the
battery is full, preventing overcharging and extending the battery’s life.
